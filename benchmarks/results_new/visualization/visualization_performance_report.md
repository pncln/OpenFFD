Generated on: 2025-07-02 07:34:35
## Executive Summary
### Point Processing Performance:
- Best throughput: 40198278.1 points/second
- Configuration: 2,000,000 points, 1.0 workers

### Rendering Performance:
- Best rendering throughput: 0.0 triangles/second
- Quality level: low

### Memory Efficiency:
- Best efficiency: 16777216.0 points/MB

## Performance Recommendations
### For Interactive Visualization:
- Use 'low' or 'medium' quality settings for real-time interaction
- Enable parallel processing for meshes > 100,000 points
- Limit triangle count to < 50,000 for smooth interaction
### For High-Quality Rendering:
- Use 'high' or 'ultra' quality for publication figures
- Monitor memory usage for large meshes
- Consider mesh chunking for very large datasets
### For Large-Scale Visualization:
- Use point cloud mode for exploratory analysis
- Implement level-of-detail (LOD) strategies
- Use parallel processing with 4-8 workers for optimal performance
